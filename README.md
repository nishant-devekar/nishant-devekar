**Architecting the future of food commerce.**  
Currently shaping global B2B food supply chains at **[FoodBridge.io](https://foodbridge.io)** as a Product Strategist, System Architect, and hands-on Builder.

### 🌍 What I’m Doing

I’m not just writing code —  
I’m **orchestrating a transformation** in how food moves through complex supply chains.

At **FoodBridge**, we’re building a unified digital infrastructure for the **entire B2B food ecosystem** — connecting sellers, buyers, logistics, finance, and marketing under one intelligent, scalable platform.

From onboarding the smallest merchant in local region to enabling international trade and transparent workflows, we’re redefining how the food industry collaborates, transacts, and grows.

### 🚀 Why It Matters

> **I’m creating the rails for a connected, collaborative, and data-driven future.**

- Building for **scale across regions**
- Empowering **local vendors** with tools once exclusive to enterprise
- Enabling **cross-border commerce** through a digital-first B2B network
- Bringing clarity to **inventory, credit, commissions**, and operational chaos

### 🔬 Tech When It Matters

I’ve also ventured into **3D/AR interfaces** to elevate the digital product experience — because even enterprise tools should be delightful.
